I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die! There was an old lady who swallowed a spider; That wriggled and jiggled and 
tickled inside her!

She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady that swallowed a dog; What a hog, to swallow a dog!

She swallowed the dog to catch the cat, She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, She swallowed the bird to catch the spider; 
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her! 
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!
